				<br>
Thank you for the life we shared.
<br>
Until we meet again, my last risk and greatest love
<br>
I don't regret anything about us, I gave the better version ofme. But if there's one thing I wish you could have seen, it would be the little things I did for love and for you. 
<br>
I want to see you achieve everything you told me about before, even without me in your life. Everything happens for a reason. I'm glad that I've loved and been loved by you. It doesn't mean I don't love you anymore, but i just realized everything haschanged, everything is no longer the way it used to be.
<br>
I tried to fix everything as much as I could. I always prioritize you over myself. I don't care about my mental health, I always put you before me because I love you so deeply. I'm willing to take a risk, I don't careif I lose. I just want you to feel loved by me, but your actions told me to stop. I think it is better to end everything between us than to hurt each other over and over again. 
<br>
Letting you. go is the hardest decision I have ever made. I may not good enough for you, but at least I tried to be better for you, no regrets at all I'm sorry for disappointing you. Leaving you is my last act of love, my love my greatest love
Until we meet again.
<br>
			Love,
          	<br>Reza S.
